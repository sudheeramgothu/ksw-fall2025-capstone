# ksw-fall2025-capstone
KSW University Fall 2025 Capstone – Cloud-Native CI/CD pipeline with Kubernetes, GitOps, DevSecOps, and Observability. Mentorship-driven academic–industry project guided by Sudheer Amgothu.

This repository documents the KSW University Fall 2025 Capstone Project, mentored by Sudheer Amgothu (Principal Cloud Operations Engineer).
Over 12 weeks, students will:

Build a CI/CD pipeline with Jenkins and GitHub.

Deploy applications on Kubernetes clusters using GitOps (ArgoCD/Flux).

Integrate DevSecOps practices (RBAC, vulnerability scans).

Implement monitoring & observability with Prometheus and Grafana.

Deliver a final demo, documentation, and presentation at Computing Showcase Day (Dec 2025).
