# Week 1 â€“ Kickoff & Planning  

ðŸ“… **Timeline:** Sept 2025 (Week 1)  
ðŸŽ¯ **Objective:** Get organized, set up repositories, assign roles, and draft the initial CI/CD architecture.

## âœ… This Weekâ€™s Focus
1. **GitHub Setup**  
   - Create GitHub **organization** & repositories.  
   - Branching structure: `main` â†’ `dev` â†’ `feature/*`.  
   - Define **commit message format** (example: `feat: add Jenkinsfile`, `fix: Docker build issue`).  
   - Establish **PR review process** (at least 1 peer review before merge).  

2. **Role Assignment**  
   Assign student leads for:  
   - **CI/CD (Jenkins)**  
   - **GitOps/Kubernetes**  
   - **Monitoring (Prometheus/Grafana)**  
   - **Documentation / Project Management**  

3. **Draft CI/CD Architecture Diagram**  
   - Rough flow to include:  
     ```
     GitHub â†’ Jenkins â†’ Docker Registry â†’ Kubernetes â†’ ArgoCD/Flux â†’ Monitoring (Prometheus/Grafana)
     ```  
   - Use any diagramming tool (Lucidchart, Draw.io, Excalidraw, or Mermaid in Markdown).  
   - Save diagram in repo under `Week01/diagram.png`.  

4. **Project Planning Document (1â€“2 pages)**  
   - Team roles & responsibilities.  
   - Selected tools (CI/CD, registry, monitoring).  
   - Initial timeline (based on 12-week roadmap).  
   - Repo setup details.
