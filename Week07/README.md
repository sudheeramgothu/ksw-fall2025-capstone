# Week 7 â€“ DevSecOps Integration (Part 1)

ðŸ“… **Timeline:** Oct 2025 (Week 7)  
ðŸŽ¯ **Objective:** Strengthen the CI/CD pipeline by applying Kubernetes **RBAC policies**, integrating **vulnerability scanning** with Trivy, and adding a **security stage** to the Jenkins pipeline.

---

## âœ… This Weekâ€™s Focus

1. **Apply Kubernetes RBAC Policies**
   - Define **roles and role bindings** for your Flask app and GitOps components.
   - Restrict permissions to follow **least privilege** principles.
   - Create a new file under `infra/security/rbac.yaml` to define:
     - Role â†’ e.g., access to pods, services, and deployments only.
     - RoleBinding â†’ link the Role to your ServiceAccount used by ArgoCD or the application.

2. **Run Vulnerability Scans with Trivy**
   - Install **Trivy** locally or use the Docker container:
     ```bash
     docker run --rm -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock aquasec/trivy image <REGISTRY>/<APP_NAME>:<TAG>
     ```
   - Scan the built Docker image for vulnerabilities.
   - Save a sample Trivy report (`Week07/trivy-report.txt`).
   - Identify any **high/critical vulnerabilities** and summarize findings.

3. **Add Scanning Stage to Jenkinsfile**
   - Update your Jenkinsfile to include a **Security Scan** stage after the build stage.
   - The pipeline should:
     - Run Trivy scan inside Jenkins.
     - Archive scan results as artifacts.
     - Optionally, fail the build on high severity findings.

## ðŸ“¦ Deliverables by End of Week 7
- âœ… `infra/security/rbac.yaml` created and applied to cluster.  
- âœ… Trivy scan completed and results saved (`Week07/trivy-report.txt`).  
- âœ… Jenkinsfile updated with a Security Scan stage.  
- âœ… Screenshot of Jenkins security scan stage (`Week07/jenkins-security-stage.png`).
